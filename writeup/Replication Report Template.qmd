<!-- Replication reports should all use this template to standardize reporting across projects.  These reports will be public supplementary materials that accompany the summary report(s) of the aggregate results. -->

## Introduction

[No abstract is needed.]  Each replication project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and results.  These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole.  Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of data collection.  Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for replication, and any other essential information.  It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense. 


My primary research interests revolve around children's metacognition and belief revision. How do the recognize anomolies to their existing beliefs, 
and how do they acquire a sense of intellectual humility to recognize gaps in their own knowledge? Connected to this idea is knowing just 
how much information or certainty one may need in order to make a decision or revise an existing belief. This particular experiment provides evidence 
that both children and adults are able to do this-- they flexibly adjust their responses depending on the difficulty of a problem (i.e., predicting 
how much information is necessary to come to a decision). This result connects to some of the work I’m currently developing on children’s uncertainty 
tolerance. Instead of examining whether or not people are sensitive to the amount of information needed, I’m interested in how much uncertainty an 
individual is willing to have present when committing to a decision. Though this particular result shows a group level sensitivity to conducting an 
“intuitive power analysis,” it helps to inform my current work on behavior at the individual level. 
	
This study broadly investigates whether children and adults can intuitively perform a power analysis (i.e., whether people are sensitive to the 
amount of evidence needed in order to make a particular inference or decision). In order to answer this question, participants are shown 10 pairs of 
boxes, each pair containing a different distribution of colored balls. There are 10 separate test trials, each displaying two boxes filled with 
colored balls with inverse proportions of one another (e.g., 95/5 vs. 5/95). The difficulty of the trials vary from 51/49 to 95/5, with the order 
randomized for each participant. On each trial, participants are shown two boxes, each belonging to a different character. They must enter a number for how many balls should be taken out of the boxes in order for them to determine which of the two boxes is being sampled. They measure whether participants adjust their sampling behavior as distributions get harder/easier to discriminate. I plan to replicate Experiment 1 from the paper for my replication, and I will use a linear effects model to uncover how participants' sampling decisions relate to the difficulty of each distribution.
	
The primary challenge will be to redesign each of the stimuli, as there are 10 separate trials, with 200 visible balls across the two boxes per 
trial. Each trial has its own color scheme of balls inside, and it will be time consuming to replicate the boxes exactly as they appear in the 
original paper. The rest of the procedure should be fairly simple to recreate in terms of design.

## Methods

### Power Analysis
Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

The paper reports using G*Power to conduct a power analysis. They found that in order to get an effect size of 0.4 achieve a power level of 0.9 (90%), they needed 30 adult participants. Because this replication study will be conducted on an online platform, this planned sample size is extremely feasible.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.
The planned sample size is 30 adults. As in the original study, participants will be excluded if they fail the attention check question and must be at least 18 years old in order to participate. There are no other eligibility criteria. 

### Materials
All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

All stimuli will be created digitally for the experiment using R studio and JsPsych. Following the design of Experiment 1, participants will first see two boxes with inverse proportions of balls (i.e., 72/28, 28/72) in a training trial. There will be ten separate test trials and each will show participants two boxes, one belonging to the "narrator" and one to a "character." Boxes will contain proportions of balls with distributions that range in difficulty to discriminate between (i.e., 95/5, 90/10, 85/15, 80/20, 75/25, 70/30, 65/35, 60/40, 55/45, 51/49). Because I will be recreating the stimuli on my own, I will use the same colors as in the original paper. The positions of each colored ball may differ slightly, but the proportions/numbers of each color will be exactly the same.

### Procedure	
Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.
Training Trial
Procedure for the training trial will closely follow that of the original paper: "Adults were shown a short animation that walked them through the setup of the task, in which images of two boxes of balls with inverse proportions were shown being shuffled behind a barrier so the location of each was unknown. Then a hand reached into one of the boxes and picked balls one at a time and placed them into an opaque bowl without revealing the colour of each ball. After the container was filled, the contents were revealed and participants were asked to judge which of the two boxes the sample had been drawn from. The training trial was done with a 72/28 ratio set, and was designed to be an easy discrimination. Failure to choose the correct box was used as an exclusion criterion". 
The paper does not specify the number of balls drawn during this trial, however participants in the replication will view 11 balls. 8 of them (72%) will be in the majority color and 3 (28%) will be in the minority color in order to directly reflect the distribution of the box being sampled. The short animation video will differ slightly, given that I will be recreating the stimuli, but conceptually, the content will be the same. I will follow the rest of the protocol as closely as possible, however the attention check prompt may differ slightly in wording, given that it was not listed in the section.

Test Trials
The procedure for each of the 10 test trials will be identical to the original paper: "Participants were then shown four characters, each with a set of two boxes, to give them a sense of the range of contrasts in the task and were told ‘This time, you will be deciding how many balls I should put in the bowl. For each friend, think about how tricky it will be to figure out which box I am picking from. For some friends you might need more balls to decide which box they are picked from, and for some friends you might need fewer. Try not to ask for more balls than you need.’ Ten sets of boxes each with a new character were presented one at a time, along with a question asking ‘How many balls do you think I need to put in the bowl for you to know whether the balls came from my box or (the current character)’s box?’ Participants simply had to type in the number of samples that they thought they would need to discriminate each pair. The proportions in the test stimuli varied from very easy discriminations (95/5) to very difficult ones (51/49). Adults were not told the specific ratios; they had to estimate the difficulty of the discrimination problem from the visual display. Nor were adults told the exact number of balls in the box. One hundred balls  were visible on the face of the box but the boxes were presented as three-dimensional sketches so, assuming participants thought the boxes were cubes, they might have inferred that there were roughly 1,000 balls in each box. The instructions indicated sampling without replacement and in principle this could be modelled by a hypergeometric distribution (that is, the probability of a coloured ball would change after each draw). However, given the inferred size of the population, sampling with or without replacement would make little difference thus for simplicity, we modelled the probability of drawing a coloured ball as a binomial distribution. Participants were not given any feedback on their responses and the order in which the ten boxes were presented was randomized for each participant."


### Reliability and Validity
The key construct measured in this project is the idea of having an "intuitive power analysis." This is measured by showing participants 10 pairs of boxes, each with different proportions of balls inside. They will measure whether or not participants request more samples for harder distributions and fewer for easier distributions. If this is the case, they can conclude that people are sensitive to the fact that different amounts of data or information is needed depending on the difficulty of a particular problem. The authors do not report any reliability or validity information, and given that this is a novel task with one trial for each distribution, there is not a lot of opportunity to examine how reliable or valid the measure is (e.g., whether effects would hold if participants were given multiple trials for the same distribution, perhaps with different colored balls). This is also the only measure that is used in the paper, however they do compare participant's performance (LMM) to a null model and find a significant p value (obtained through likelihood ratio tests), suggesting that participant's performance does well mirror behavior predicted by the null model and the task likely did capture the construct of interest. 


### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

I plan to conduct the key analysis from Experiment 1 and I will follow their analysis steps directly. 
First, they identified a null model, which they reach by "model(ing) an agent who represents all of the possible contents of a sample of a particular size N (for example, in a sample of N = 3 balls, it could contain three white balls, three coloured balls, one white and two coloured balls, or two white and one coloured ball), then weights them on the basis of the likelihood of drawing that particular sample from the population. We then use a cumulative distribution function to model the sampling process, with N being the total number of samples drawn (restricted to even-numbered samples using a ceiling operator), x representing the number of samples that are coloured and p representing the probability that a given sample is a particular colour (that is, the probability associated with a given box). When most of the possible samples of a given size point to one of the two options, then participants should decide the sample is big enough; if not, then participants should request a larger sample."
After data collection, I will use a linear mixed effects model to examine participants' sampling behavior as it relates to distribution difficulty. As listed in the paper, I will make the "proportion of coloured balls a fixed effect, with participant as a random intercept. P values were obtained by likelihood ratio tests comparing the full model with a null model that left out the effect of proportion."

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

The original study was run online via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. This replication will either be run with undergraduates though a university research survey platform or via prolific. The exact procedure should be nearly identical to the original study, with possible modifications to the attention check prompt and the number of samples extracted during the training trials (see Procedure section for more detailed deviations from the original study). Conceptually, all of the information presented to participants should be the same as in the original task, thus it is unlikely that these differences should have an impact on the claims made in the original article. 

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
Because each of my measures will be identical to that of the original experiment, my data preparation will be the same as they did. Step one of my data preparation will be to account for exclusions. There is one attention check at the end of the familiarization trial. The original experiment excluded participants if they failed this question, and I will do the same. The key variables that will be used in the linear mixed effects model will be the exact answers participants answer to each of the ten test trials (i.e., a numerical value for the number of samples participants think should be drawn). In order to prepare the data, I will make the dataframe into long form, such that participants have multiple rows, one for each individual trial.

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  
I will run a linear mixed effects model with trial proportions as a fixed effect and participants as a random intercept. I will then use likelihood ratio tests, comparing the LMM to the null model (as specified above in the analysis plan) to assess significance. This statistical output will directly examine whether or not participants' sampling behaviors differ with distribution difficulty, so I believe it to be a well-suited analysis for the purposes of this replication. I will also aim to recreate the original graph for this analysis as well.

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
